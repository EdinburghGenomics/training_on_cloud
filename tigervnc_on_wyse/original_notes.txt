Where are my notes on how I got access to the thin client 04 on the desk and made VNC
work?

I'm not sure.

I gained access using the reset-on-boot and then the default password.
My notes simply say:

"Boot with 'G' then admin/admin"

Then I got a shell and unpacked TigerVNC from a USB stick. I also remember I set
a root password which the thin client says is not for local access but of course
you can force a root prompt easily enough.

Command for connection is:
???

But I think what I really want to do is get on the training server, work out how
spice-client was packaged up (by Stuart?!) and then repeat that to push TigerVNC as
a snap to all thin clients and to add a script to get them to auto-connect, based on
their ID numbers (how do they know these numbers?).

But I can put this aside for now.
